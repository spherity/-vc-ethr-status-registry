        contract in which revocation information can be stored and modified in an unlimited amount of <a>revocation

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Verifiable Credentials specification describes revocation as one of the key parts of the Verifiable
        Credentials lifecycle. It allows issuers of credentials to revoke them when appropriate in a way that is
        transparent to potential verifiers in the future.
        The VC specification however does not describe a revocation method and only focuses on the general idea with
        some general requirements and considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those considerations mainly include privacy concerns in the form of possible deanonymization attacks by an
        issuer when a verifier checks the revocation status of a credential with it. In the worst case, an issuer might
        figure out what credential holder presented which credential to which verifier and when. This especially holds
        true for revocation methods storing the revocation list on an issuer-owned and centralized revocation
        service.
        Revocation methods like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                   href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/">Status List 2021</a> leverage
        such an infrastructure but try to minimize privacy concerns
        by using revocation lists encoded in a bitstring. Following this pattern, a verifier verifies a credential by
        retrieving the full revocation list from the issuers server and reading the credential's status from the correct
        position in the bitstring.
        For most applications, this approach is sufficient from a privacy perspective but falls short in other critical
        points.
    </p>
    <p>
        The largest problem with traditional revocation lists is the centralized aspect of them. Most of them rely on
        HTTP servers as well as caching and are therefore vulnerable to known attack vectors, which include
        unavailability or illegal modification of the revocation list. Depending on the ecosystem, an unavailable and
        untrustworthy revocation list may make verifications impossible for an undefined timespan and therefore present
        an unacceptable business risk. Other noteworthy aspects are historical preservation of revocation information,
        the burden of owning and maintaining revocation infrastructure, and inflexibility in terms of revocation list
        management features (e.g. delegation).
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest of the document proposes a new revocation method based on the EIP-5539 standard draft that leverages a
        decentralized revocation <a>registry</a> inside an Ethereum smart contract. It allows any Ethereum address to
        manage an unlimited number of <a>revocation lists</a> in its <a>namespace</a>, where each list can hold an
        unlimited amount of revocation keys. Because <a>revocation lists</a> are hosted on the blockchain,
        issuers can't correlate sensitive information anymore, like at what moment a verifier retrieves revocation
        information. Other positive aspects are the increased herd privacy due to huge <a>namespaces</a> and
        <a>revocation lists</a>, the infrastructure being always available, infrastructure does not have to be
        maintained by issuers, and the ability to program smart management features into the <a>registry</a> itself
        (meta transactions, <a>owner</a>changes, delegation, ...).

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    This section describes the core concepts of this specification. Revocations are stored in <a>revocation lists</a>
    as a key-value pair of a bytes32 string to a boolean value. The boolean value indicates the status of the
    <a>revocation key</a>where true is revoked. <a>Revocation lists</a> are identified by a bytes32 string key that are
    part of a <a>namespace</a>. <a>Namespaces</a> are represented by Ethereum addresses and can, due to the bytes32
    size of revocation list keys, can contain an unlimited amount of <a>revocation lists</a> that are implicitly owned
    by the <a>namespaces</a>address. The described behaviour can be seen in figure 1.

    <figure id="bitstring">
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 100%;"
             src="assets/registry-concept.svg"
             alt="diagram showing how multiple namespace nodes are connected to a registry< node. Each namespace node points to multiple revocation list nodes that point to multiple revocation key nodes. Each revocation key node has a revoked status inside its node that represents the revocation status of that particular revocation key.">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
            A visual depiction of the concepts.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    This architecture enables a decentralized and general-purpose revocation <a>registry</a> that can be used by any
    Ethereum address without any previous deployment of smart contracts or self-managed infrastructure. Due to amount
    of Ethereum addresses and the key type of bytes32 for <a>revocation lists</a> and <a>revocation keys</a> , there is
    an infinite amount of <a>revocation lists</a> and <a>revocation keys</a> that can be stored in the <a>registry</a>.
    Due to the nature of the underlying data structures used in the registry, all possible <a>namespaces</a> and their
    <a>revocation lists</a> and <a>revocation keys</a> are already initialized with zero values. This means that there
    is no writing action needed when issuing a revocable credential with this method. Only when a credential needs to be
    revoked, data is written to the chain. Consequently, revocation information of a credential is only recorded
    on-chain when its status is changed.

    The underlying <a>registry</a> also provides multiple management features for <a>namespace</a> owners. These features
    include:
    <ul>
        <li>Delegation: A <a>namespace</a> owner can add <a>delegates</a> to <a>revocation lists</a> it controls to
            grant writing access to other entities.
        </li>
        <li>Owner Change: An <a>owner</a> of a <a>revocation list</a> can give up its writing access to another Ethereum
            address. The <a>revocation list</a> will stay in its original <a>namespace</a> to not break already issued
            credentials.
        </li>
        <li>Meta Transactions: An <a>owner</a> of a <a>revocation list</a> can generate a proof that can be used by a
            third party to carry out a writing action in the registry. This might be helpful for off-loading
            interactions with Ethereum and its costs to someone else.
        </li>
    </ul>
