This specification describes a decentralized, registry-based revocation mechanism for Verifiable Credentials on Ethereum. It is based on the EIP-5539 standard draft and leverages its described revocation registry smart contract in which revocation information can be stored and modified in an unlimited amount of revocation lists residing in namespaces.
